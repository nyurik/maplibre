The primary goal of receiving donations is to move the project forward.
Thus, donations should be distributed towards the goals that otherwise might not get done.

We can break payments into the following categories:
* **Expenses**, such as domain registration, legal work (trademark), hosting if needed, and other expense reimbursement.
* **Low-interst Tasks**, which are anything that attracts fewer volunteer contributions.  This could include project management tasks, managing issues, build/release processes, CI set up, web site maintenance, communications such as newsletters and blog posts, documentation, or any code that is critical to MapLibre success, but is not that much "fun" to work on.
* **Rewarded features** (name TBD?) -- some new functionaly that received additional financial incentive by sponsors or the board.

Note that the above does not include "fun features" -- anything that already generates enough excitement in the community, and gets volunteer submissions as is.
